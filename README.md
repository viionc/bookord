Real-time chat application.

It was built with Vite, Authentication, Database, and hosting provided by Firebase.

Currently available features:

- authentication system that allows creating new users (later on added ability to login as anonymous)

- realtime chat

- separate channels

- ability to create new chat channels

- admin, moderator, chatter role system

- user list (I'm not sure if it's possible to display only online users using Firestore)

- ability to moderate channels (remove messages, remove channels)

- private channels (online invited users or moderators can see it)
  
- avatar system

- some responsiveness (it's a bit buggy atm, still working on it)

- ability to change channel settings (name, members of the channel, privacy level) and an option to delete channel

- user profiles
